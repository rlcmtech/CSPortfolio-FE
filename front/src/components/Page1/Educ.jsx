  <li className='educ-li'>I hold a BS in Information Technology, which gave me a solid foundation in systems and programming — allowing me to understand the technical side of computer and digital technologies.</li>

   <li className='educ-li'>Later, I earned 18 education units and became a licensed teacher — a path that sharpened my ability to explain complex topics clearly. I then pursued a Master’s in Educational Management to deepen my understanding of leadership and how organizations operate — knowledge that connects well with security awareness and compliance.</li>
  
    <li className='educ-li'>Recently, I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp where I built hands-on projects using the MERN stack, focusing on authentication and secure backend logic. Most recently, I earned my CompTIA Security+ certification, officially shifting my career toward cybersecurity, where I specialize in risk management, secure systems, and incident response.</li>
